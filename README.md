normalized word frequencies to facilitate in-depth analysis.
- Evaluated and scored sentences based on word frequency metrics, enabling the ranking of sentences by their
relevance and importance.

articles, generating concise summaries.
- Utilized Seaborn to create bar plots illustrating the distribution of articles by publication year.
